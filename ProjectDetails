Project Introduction:

The main objective is to understand whether specific properties of products for retails stores like Dmart, Reliance smart, play a significant role in terms of increasing or decreasing sales volume. To achieve this goal, we will build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store and draw recommendations for the each store based on city type.


Dataset:
	 
Data Manipulation & Cleaning:

1.	Some columns need to be corrected for a good analysis. 
2.	Data needs to be correct as observed some junk values will be there
3.	Where ever null values are there , need to replace zero
4.	Text values needs to be numerous as pre processing required 
5.	Needs to verify for each column and corresponding values  as there should not be missing data
Data Preparation:
1.	Input data preparation 
2.	Target Data preparation
3.	Need to split the data to test and improve model efficiency
 

Modeling:
1.	You need to identify the model  based on given data 
2.	Select the best model based on accuracy 
3.	Algorithm should address the sales prediction in case new outlets get sanctioned by company based on location as well trained data

Recommendation Engine:

1.	Algorithm needs to be identified the recommendation what products to keep in store and what not to keep on store based on store location based on train data.
2.	Recommend new products to super markets stores based on seasons.
3.	Need to generate new product Id , category
4.	Generated products need to map with recommendation.
Example: One super market has high sales on dairy products , can recommend more dairy products.
Based on Indian festival season , what specials to keep for example in case of diwali , sweets and dry fruits can recommend on type 1 cities.
